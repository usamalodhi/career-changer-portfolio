# Career Changer Portfolio

The Career Changer Portfolio is intended for the use of graduate computer science students or Bootcamp graduates to use a template for their Portfolio.

## Description

Computer science students and Bootcamp graduates face a very competitive market in landing their first software development role. Their first stumbling block is designing and building a portfolio to showcase their projects but in the majority of cases they either have not started building their projects or need time finalising them. Coincidentally they most likely do not have a portfolio either. The career changer portfolio is intended to be used as a template so graduates can focus on their projects and have a modern portfolio template they can edit to showcase their work.

The Career Changer Portfolio is written in TypeScript on the Next JS Framework, and the css libraries Chakra UI and Framer Motion to afford a modern, stylish and responsive website.

## Getting Started

### pre-requisites

- It is recommended to have installed the latest version of Node JS

### Installation and Execution

First clone the repository using the code below

```
git clone git@github.com:usamalodhi/career-changer-portfolio.git
```

Change into the root directory of the cloned project and install dependencies

```
npm i
```

## Help

It is recommended to read the documentation on the various dependencies used e.g. Next JS, Chakra UI, Framer Motion, TypeScript etc as the portfolio is highly customisable and it is encouraged to come up with a design an experience that reflects you as a developer

It is recommended to review the files in the pages/ and components/ directory to familiarise yourself with the structure and see which props need to be edited so the correct data is passed via props e.g. Your Name, URL links to your deployed projects, github repositories, etc
